        <h2>Basic HTML Tags</h2>
        <p>You learned the following about basic HTML tags in this module:</p>

        <section>
            <h3>line break</h3>
            [cite_start]<p>The <code>br</code> [cite: 2] [cite_start]is used to create line breaks in code[cite: 3].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>Line breaks are commonly used for mailing addresses and should not be used for formatting a web page[cite: 3].</p>
            [cite_start]<p><code>CSS</code> [cite: 4][cite_start], which is discussed later in the course, should be used for formatting a web page[cite: 4].</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>whitespace</h3>
            [cite_start]<p>Whitespace is the unprinted character created by hitting the space bar[cite: 5].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>No matter how many spaces are entered, the browser recognizes it as one space[cite: 6].</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>sections</h3>
            [cite_start]<p>A section is a collection of related paragraphs, images, or other content that includes a heading[cite: 7].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>You can have sections inside sections inside sections[cite: 8]. [cite_start]They are a **container tag** [cite: 8] used to group content together.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>headings</h3>
            [cite_start]<p>A heading provides a title for a section of content[cite: 9].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>There are six levels of headings[cite: 10]:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><code>h1</code></li>
                <li><code>h2</code></li>
                <li><code>h3</code></li>
                <li><code>h4</code></li>
                <li><code>h5</code></li>
                <li><code>h6</code></li>
            </ol>
            [cite_start]<p>The **<code>h1</code>** [cite: 11] [cite_start]tag is the first level heading and should describe the contents of the entire page[cite: 11].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>It **MUST be used first** [cite: 12] [cite_start]in your document, before any other heading level[cite: 12].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>In this assignment, the **<code>h1</code>** [cite: 13] [cite_start]tag is at the top of the page and contains the content "Module 2 Notes - HTML Common Tags"[cite: 13].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>On a real site, your <code>h1</code> [cite: 14] [cite_start]and title would normally contain the same text[cite: 14].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>The <code>h2</code> through <code>h6</code> [cite: 15] [cite_start]tags should be used for subtopics/subchapters[cite: 15].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>You may not skip heading levels [cite: 16][cite_start], and headings should **not be used for style**[cite: 16].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>By the time you are done coding this assignment, you should have a better understanding of heading tags[cite: 17].</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>text formatting</h3>
            [cite_start]<p>There are a number of html tags that can cause the text to render in a different way in the browser[cite: 18].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>You can learn more about text formatting tags at developer.mozilla.org [cite: 19] $\textregistered$ $\text{}$ (Trademark Symbol)</p>
            [cite_start]<p>Below is a partial list of some text formatting tags that you learned in this module[cite: 20].</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>em</code></li>
                <li><code>strong</code></li>
                <li><code>b</code></li>
                <li><code>i</code></li>
                <li><code>code</code></li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <h2>Special Characters</h2>
        [cite_start]<p>Entities are used for coding special characters[cite: 21]. [cite_start]While there are three ways to code entities, it is **recommended** [cite: 21] [cite_start]that you use the entity name[cite: 21].</p>
        [cite_start]<p>It is the easiest to remember[cite: 22]. [cite_start]You can learn more about character entities at w3schools.com[cite: 22].</p>
        [cite_start]<p>The most common characters that you will use in this course are those for the trademark symbol and the copyright symbol[cite: 23].</p>
        [cite_start]<p>Non-breaking spaces should only be used to keep two words together [cite: 24][cite_start], so one word does not wrap to the next line[cite: 24].</p>
        [cite_start]<p>For example, **Paradise&nbsp;Bakery** [cite: 25] [cite_start]would probably want those two words to appear together at all times[cite: 25].</p>
        [cite_start]<p>They would never want the word Paradise on one line and then have the word Bakery wrapped to the next line[cite: 26].</p>
        [cite_start]<p>To keep the words together, you would code a non-breaking space between the two words so it would be treated as one long word[cite: 27].</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Lists</h2>
        [cite_start]<p>The two most common types of lists are ordered lists and unordered Lists [cite: 28]</p>

        <section>
            <h3>Ordered Lists</h3>
            [cite_start]<p>Ordered lists should be used for lists that require an order[cite: 29].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>The steps needed to enroll in a course at ASU might be one example of an ordered list[cite: 29].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>There are many steps, and they need to be done in a **specific order**[cite: 30].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>Ordered lists would also be used for a list where the items are ranked[cite: 31].</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Unordered Lists</h3>
            [cite_start]<p>Unordered lists should be used for lists that **do not require order**[cite: 32].</p>
            <p>An unordered list was used above for the various text formatting tags.</p>
